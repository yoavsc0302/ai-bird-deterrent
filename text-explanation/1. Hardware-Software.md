# Person-Tracking System with Laser

## Project Purpose
This is a person-tracking system that uses AI to detect people in a video feed and automatically aims a laser at them by controlling a pan/tilt servo mechanism.

## Core Components

### 1. Hardware Layer
- **Raspberry Pi 5**: Main controller
- **Camera Module 3**: For video input
- **Hailo-8L AI Accelerator**: For efficient ML processing
- **Pan/Tilt Servo Assembly**: For aiming
- **KY008 Laser Module**: Laser for tracking and aiming

### 2. Software Layer
#### GStreamer Pipeline:
- Handles video stream from the camera
- Performs ML inference using Hailo-8L
- Tracks persons with unique IDs
- Processes detections and calculates coordinates

#### Controllers:
- Manages configuration for all components
- Controls servo for pan/tilt mechanism
- Controls laser for on/off switching

## Basic Operation Flow
1. Camera feeds video into the GStreamer pipeline.
2. Hailo-8L runs the YOLOv8 model for person detection.
3. The system tracks the detected person's position.
4. Servo controller calculates angles based on the person's position.
5. Laser is activated and aimed at the tracked person.
